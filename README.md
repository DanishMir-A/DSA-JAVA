This repository contains my daily Data Structures & Algorithms practice in Java,
following a pattern-based approach (Arrays, Hashing, Two Pointers, etc.).

### Goals
- Build strong problem-solving skills
- Maintain daily consistency
- Prepare for technical interviews

### Structure
Each folder represents a DSA pattern.
Each file contains:
- Clean Java solution
- Time & space complexity
- Clear logic
